Candidate structures of allele A and C: 
Allele_A.txt and Allele_C.txt

Process Reads: AlleleReadsAc

PROCESSING:
1. Run DMSMaPSeq.xcodeproj C++ project. Please initialize your own file path. Three files are saved (AlleleReadsAC, Allele, AlleleMAPResponse_shortfolds.txt and AlleleMAPDSMatrix_shortfolds.txt).
2. Run NNLS_DMS_MaPSeq.R R script to get the final results. Please initialize your own path.
